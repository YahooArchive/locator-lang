What is this example?
---------------------

This examples demonstrate how to use `locator-lang` in an express application that relies on `locator` to abstract the file system. In this particular case it abstract the access to language bundle files, so we can use those lang entries on the server and client.

How does it work?
-----------------

In this example there is only one `locatorBundle`, the app itself and it is named `demo` from `package.json` (name definition). Also, there is only one `langBundle` denotated by `foo`, which corresponds to `lang/foo.json` file.

On the server side, you should rely on locator to collect the lang entries, while on the client, you should rely on a module system to provision the lang entries when needed (in this example we use YUI module format for that).

How to test this app?
---------------------

First, install the demo dependencies, then run the express application:

```
npm install
node app.js
```

Navigate to:

* http://localhost:3000/demo/foo

It produces a json object with the entries collected by the plugin.

Navigate to:

* http://localhost:3000/demo-0.0.1/demo-lang-foo.js

It accesses to the static yui module generated by the plugin.
